# The day of my changes

Just a year ago, somehow i start motivating my self to live a healthy life. Actually before that i was quit smoking. In the begining of the June i said my self - that's it, enough smoking cigarettes. And off course my son was born, that's also push me to do the right things. 

So the results - my weight was 96kg, a real bomberman :) So actually i wasn't feel fine of my self. The first run was 3.24km/21.19 min. It was 1km/6.35min. I was dead after my first run, but it keeps me motivated to not smoke again. First 10k per 1:06:25.

Until October my weight significantly loss 21kg and in total i was 75kg as my average.

The next thing what i did - no more alcohol starting from a new 2018 year (excluding company birthday). 

So today my 1k pace 4:53, 5k - 27:30, 10k - 55:37. The longest run 16.09km, Elevation gain 	2,597m.

All time 508.1km in total of 88 runs.
