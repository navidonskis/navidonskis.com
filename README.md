# Personal Site with React.js

Hello, my name is Donatas Navidonskis. I'm Software Engineer from Lithuania. Here is my personal website at public repository.
The idea was to create my own web site (the big reload). So i decide to do it with `React` and learn that kind of awesome framework. 

Thank you Github for great tool of [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
