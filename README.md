# Personal Site with React.js

Hello, my name is Donatas Navidonskis. I'm Software Engineer from Lithuania. Here is my personal website at public repository.
The idea was to create my own web site (the big reload). So i decide to do it within `React` and to learn that kind of awesome framework. And also to host at [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
